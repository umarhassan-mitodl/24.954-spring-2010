Squib
-----

Enrolled students are required to write a squib due at the end of the semester. In the unmarked case, the squib consists of critical discussion of an article (or a group of related articles) which is relevant to the topics covered in this class. It should include:

*   a clear and self-contained presentation of the main claims and arguments in the article(s)
*   an explanation of why and how they bear on issues discussed in class
*   problems, possible amendments, or further extensions and applications

Students are strongly encouraged to make appointments to talk about their thoughts throughout the semester (not just when squibs are due). A short squib proposal is due one month before the end of term, and the squib itself is due on the last class.
